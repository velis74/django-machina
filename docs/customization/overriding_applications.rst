Overriding an application
#########################

Django-machina relies on a dynamic class-loading system that allows you to override or extend many
aspects of its applications. The django-machina applications are listed below:

+-------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Application name              | Definition                                                                                         |
+===============================+====================================================================================================+
| **forum**                     | This application provides the ability to browse a tree of forums                                   |
+-------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **forum_conversation**        | This application handles all the conversations that can happen in forums                           |
+-------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **forum_feeds**               | This application allows to get forum topics as RSS feeds                                           |
+-------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **forum_member**              | This application provides functionalities to forum members                                         |
+-------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **forum_moderation**          | This application provides moderation tools to moderators                                           |
+-------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **forum_permission**          | This application provides the proper tools to allow permission checks on forums                    |
+-------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **forum_search**              | This application allows to search within forums                                                    |
+-------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **forum_tracking**            | This application allows to determine which forums or topics have been read by a given user         |
+-------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

.. note::

    Overriding these applications is not a trivial task. Most of the time you will need to dig into
    the source code of django-machina in order to discover how things were implemented. This will
    allow you to find exactly which method should be rewritten in order to achieve the task at hand.

Duplicate the application
-------------------------

Let's say we want to override the ``machina.apps.forum_conversation`` application.

.. note::

    In the next few lines we assume that your overriden applications will live in an ``apps``
    package located at the root of your project. Of course feel free to adapt the following
    guidelines to your own project structure.

Create a Python package with the same application label
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The first thing to do is to create a Python package with the same application label as the app you
want to override. This package can live under an ``apps`` Python package that acts as a root folder
for your overridden applications, as shown below:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ mkdir -p apps/forum_conversation
  $ touch apps/__init__.py
  $ touch apps/forum_conversation/__init__.py

Import the application models if needed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All django-machina's applications do not necessarily contain models. So this step may be skipped
depending on the application you want to override. In the other case, it is necessary to reference
the models of the overridden application by creating a ``models.py`` file in your package:

.. code-block:: python

  # Custom models should be declared before importing
  # django-machina models

  from machina.apps.forum_conversation.models import *  # noqa

Your overridden application may need to add new models or modify django-machina's own models. As
stated in this snippet, custom models must be declared **before** the import of the
django-machina's models. This means that you can override a django-machina model in order to change
the way it behaves if you want. Please refer to :doc:`recipes/overriding_models` to get detailed
instructions on how to override django-machina's models.

Only importing django-machina's models is not enough. You have to ensure the models migrations can
be used by your Django project. You have two possibilities to do so:

  * you can copy the content of the ``migrations`` folder from the application you want to override
    to your own local application
  * you can configure the ``MIGRATION_MODULES`` setting to reference the original migrations of the
    application you want to override

.. code-block:: python

    MIGRATION_MODULES = {
      'forum_conversation': 'machina.apps.forum_conversation.migrations',
    }

.. note::

    The second possibility should only be used if you are sure you will not define new models or
    overridden models into your local application

Import the application admin classes if needed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As previously stated, this step can be skipped if the application you want to override does not
contain models. In the other case you will want to create an ``admin.py`` file in your package in
order to reference the admin classes of the overridden application:

.. code-block:: python

  from machina.apps.forum_conversation.admin import *  # noqa

Define the application AppConfig
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Most of django-machina's applications define sublclasses of Django's ``AppConfig`` which can perform
initialization operations. Django-machina ``AppConfig`` instances are defined inside sub-modules
called ``apps``. You need to define an ``AppConfig`` subclass for your custom application by
subclassing the overridden application ``AppConfig``. So your application's ``apps.py`` should
specify something like:

.. code-block:: python

    from machina.apps.forum_conversation.apps import ForumConversationAppConfig as BaseForumConversationAppConfig

    class ForumConversationAppConfig(BaseForumConversationAppConfig):
        name = 'apps.forum_conversation'
        default = True


Add the local application to your INSTALLED_APPS
------------------------------------------------

Finally you have to tell Django to use your overridden application instead of the django-machina's
original application. You can do this by replacing the machina's original application in the
``INSTALLED_APS`` setting by the application you just created:

.. code-block:: python

  INSTALLED_APS = (
      'django.contrib.auth',
      'django.contrib.contenttypes',
      'django.contrib.sessions',
      'django.contrib.sites',
      'django.contrib.messages',
      'django.contrib.staticfiles',
      'django.contrib.admin',

      # Machina dependencies:
      'mptt',
      'haystack',
      'widget_tweaks',

      # Machina apps:
      'machina',
      'machina.apps.forum',
      'machina.apps.forum_conversation.forum_attachments',
      'machina.apps.forum_conversation.forum_polls',
      'machina.apps.forum_feeds',
      'machina.apps.forum_moderation',
      'machina.apps.forum_search',
      'machina.apps.forum_tracking',
      'machina.apps.forum_member',
      'machina.apps.forum_permission',

      # Overridden machina apps:
      'apps.forum_conversation',
  )
